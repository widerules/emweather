# What happens when you click on the widgets #

Having trouble figuring out what happens when you click on the widgets or how to refresh the widget, re-configure the widget, or launch the EmWeather application?

Widgets are now simpler in EmWeather.  When you click on the main area of a widget, or on the text description area of the 4x4 widget, it will launch the EmWeather app, showing you the forecast for the city the widget is configured for.  If you are using the 2x2, 2x4, or 4x4 widget, clicking the gear icon or the refresh icon will launch the configuration menu or refesh the forecast, respectively.

### 4x4 Widget ###

The 4x4 widget allows you to click on forecast icons in order to display the full forecast information. To launch the main app, click on the large text area with the detailed forecast information (ie. bottom 1/3 of the widget)
